# ðŸ¤– Task 1: Rule-Based Chatbot

## Project Overview
This project is part of the CODSOFT Artificial Intelligence Internship. In this task, I built a simple rule-based chatbot that responds to user inputs using predefined rules. The chatbot works with if-else conditions or basic pattern matching techniques to identify queries and provide appropriate responses. This project helps in understanding the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP), conversation flow design, and how chatbots process user inputs to generate responses.

## Features
- Greets the user and handles simple conversations  
- Provides responses for common queries (greetings, time, weather, help, etc.)  
- Uses if-else rules or regex pattern matching for decision-making  
- Simple and lightweight (no external ML models required)  

## Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- If-Else rules

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the folder.  
2. Open a terminal and navigate to task1_chatbot/.  
3. Run the chatbot:  
   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
   
## Example Interaction
User: Hello  
Bot: Hi there! How can I help you today?  

User: What is your name?  
Bot: I am your friendly rule-based chatbot ðŸ¤–  

User: Bye  
Bot: Goodbye! Have a great day ðŸ˜Š

## Future Improvements
-Add more predefined responses                                                                                                       
-Implement pattern-based matching using regex                                                                             
-Integrate with speech-to-text for voice-based chatting                                                                                  
-Move towards ML-based chatbot using NLP libraries or transformer models
